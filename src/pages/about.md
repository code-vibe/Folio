I am a Software Engineer with a background in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. My expertise spans cloud architecture, distributed systems, compilers, video engineering, and performance optimization. I focus on designing and delivering scalable, reliable software while enabling teams around me to be more effective.

I have studied and applied concepts in software architecture, human-computer interaction, program comprehension, software visualization, operating systems, and artificial intelligence. I contribute actively to open-source and have shipped production-grade software used by large user bases.

My drive is to combine technical depth with team collaborationâ€”building systems that are robust, efficient, and impactful.
